# This is basically EoL and hardly working 
If you wanna do stuff with it go ahead, though if you're just here for some small parts of it, I have rewritten some things as their own library
* If you want something to talk to NND, look at
[NicoNicoNii](https://github.com/Sekoree/NicoNicoNii)
* For MeekMoe api stuff use
[MeekMoe.Images](https://github.com/Meek-Moe/MeekMoe.Images)
* For anything else feel free to add me on Discord and ask stuff (Sekoree#3939)

The new version will be in this
https://github.com/Miku-MikuBot/mN
If you have good C# knowledge and want to help, feel free to contact me on Discord (again, Sekoree#3939)

# MikuSharp
## The Full C# version of the Hatsune Miku Discord bot!

### The bot
Rewritten from JS to C# with completely redone Music part!

### Missing Features
* Some NSFW Commands need to be updated
* Usages on some commands (and spelling mistakes)
* Some text commands

### What this is for
If you want to support the bot and/or fix bugs or add documentation, feel free to fork this and then submit a pull request with changes! New features will remain in the "update" branch and the current version will always be the "master" branch!
